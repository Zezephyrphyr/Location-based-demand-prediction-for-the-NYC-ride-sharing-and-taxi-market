# Frontend

There are two versions of the frontend visualization, a React version (in UI_ReactJs folder) and a Python version (in prototype_python_version folder). The Python version is only a prototype used for comparison purposes and as an experiment.

## Prequisites

- Nodejs >= 8.x

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the npm dependencies
```
cd UI_ReactJs
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```
npm start
```
3. The user can select different days to visualize. To do so, select a different date from a drop-down list, then click the Confirm button. Once the heat map has been refreshed, a notification will pop-up to alert the user.
